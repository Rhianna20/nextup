     <h1 id="Scrum">What is Scrum?</h1>

      <p>Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

      Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

      Scrum is simple.  It is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components. Scrum is not a methodology. Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.

        <h3> Do's</h3>

      <p>Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity.

      Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done. 

      Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the sprint. Leave out work where you

     won’t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off.

    Finally, once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project 

       management or collaboration tool, like your Jira tickets. That way, both the decision and the rationale are easy for everyone to see later.</p>

      </div>

    <div class="column">

    <h3>Don'ts</h3>

      <p>Don’t forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health

  Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't 
  be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint. If you hear concerns from the team, whether it’s about velocity, low-certainty 
work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, don’t ignore it. Address the issue, and recalibrate when necessary.
